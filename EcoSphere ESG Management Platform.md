## Green-Pulse: ESG Management Platform

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) has become a critical aspect of modern businesses. Organizations are expected to monitor carbon emissions, promote employee well-being, and maintain governance compliance. While many ERP systems collect operational data, ESG reporting is often manual, disconnected, and difficult to monitor in real time.

Green-Pulse aims to integrate ESG directly into day-to-day ERP operations by measuring sustainability metrics, encouraging employee participation, and providing meaningful reports for management.

## 2. Challenge Statement

Build an ESG Management Platform that enables organizations to measure, manage and improve their Environmental, Social and Governance performance.

The platform should integrate operational data, employee participation and compliance activities into a unified dashboard while encouraging sustainability through gamification.

## 3. Core Modules

- Environmental: Carbon accounting, emission factors, sustainability goals and carbon reports

- Social: CSR activities, employee participation, diversity metrics and engagement

- Governance: Policies, audits, compliance tracking and governance reports

- Gamification: Challenges, badges, XP, rewards and leaderboards


The application consists of Master Data and Transactional Data.

## 8. Core Configuration & Business Rules

The following are

- Reward Redemption: Employees can redeem earned Points/XP for a Reward from the catalog, subject to stock availability. Redeeming a Reward deducts the corresponding Points from the employee's balance.

- Notification System: The platform sends notifications (in-app and/or email) for at least: new compliance issue raised, CSR/Challenge approval decisions, policy acknowledgement reminders, and badge unlocks. Configurable via Settings → Notification Settings.

- Auto Emission Calculation: When enabled (Settings toggle), Carbon Transactions are calculated automatically from linked Purchase/Manufacturing/Expense/Fleet records using the relevant Emission Factor - no manual entry required.

- Evidence Requirement: When enabled (Settings toggle), CSR Activity participation cannot be marked Approved without an attached proof file.

- Badge Auto-Award: When enabled (Settings toggle), a Badge is automatically assigned to an employee the moment their XP, completed-challenge count, or other tracked metric satisfies that Badge's Unlock Rule - no manual admin action required.

- Compliance Issue Ownership: Every Compliance Issue must have an assigned Owner and a Due Date; issues that pass their Due Date while still Open should be flagged (feeds the Notification System above).
